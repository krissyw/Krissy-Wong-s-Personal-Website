# Krissy Wong's Personal Website

Hello! My name is Krissy Wong and I am a recent Master of Science in Business Analytics graduate students from Loyola Marymount University (LMU).

I am passionate to learn about the intersection of business, technology, and data. I believe business knowledge is important to translate data analysis into tangible strategies. A business background is also useful to communicate data findings to both a technical and non-technical audience. My goal is to utilize data and technology to drive positive changes for our society. Below are some of my core competencies:

# Projects 

## [reMarkable Project](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/bsan-6080-reMarkable)
I worked with a team of six students to analyze custoemr tweets about reMarkable, a Norwegian based tablet company. We created a K-means clustering model to extract popoular topics about the company. We interpreted, analyzed, and derived insights from the clusters. Our team created a [sales dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.enciso/viz/ReMarkable_Sales_Dashboard/Sales_Dashboard?publish=yes) and a [general dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tingli.lin/viz/Combined_16516139118450/Dashboard1) to help reMarkable manage KPIs.
