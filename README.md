Hello! My name is Krissy Wong and I am a recent Master of Science in Business Analytics graduate students from Loyola Marymount University (LMU).

I am passionate to learn about the intersection of business, technology, and data. I believe business knowledge is important to translate data analysis into tangible strategies. A business background is also useful to communicate data findings to both a technical and non-technical audience. My goal is to utilize data and technology to drive positive changes for our society. Below are some of my core competencies: 

Core Competencies: 
• Data Analysis & Visualizations: Microsoft Excel | Python | R | Tableau 
• Data Pipelines & Data Warehouse: SQL 
• Machine Learning & Text Analytics: Regression | Decision Trees| Random Forest | KNN | K-means | Naive Bayes | XGBoost | Gradient Boost | AdaBoost | LDA | NLP
• Computer Science: Python
• User Growth: A/B Testing | Funnel Analysis 
• Project Management: Agile | Scrum

Besides business analytics, I enjoy doing pilates, going to the gym, and cooking. :)
